# Task 1 declare a variable using `var`means we can change the value again if we want .

# Task 3 is to declare boolean number either true or false or 0 or 1 by using  `const` variable which means value doesnt change later.
# In task 4 we have to declare datatypes in a variables.

# In the Task 5 we have to initialise variable then assign the values after console we have to reasign the value in the variable so we use `let` instead of const because when we declare a `const` variable then value become fixed.
